#1. Assign value 47 to variable Num1
Num1 = 47
#2. Assign value 102 to a variable Num2
Num2 = 102
#3. Sum variables Num1 and Num2, and put the result into Sum variable
Sum = Num1 + Num2
#4. Subtract Num1 from Num2, then store the result in the Diff variable.
Diff = Num2 - Num1
#5. Multiply Sum and Diff, then place the resulting product in Product.
Product = Sum * Diff 
#6. Print the sum operation “{Num1} + {Num2} = {Sum}”
print(Num1, "+", Num2, "=", Sum)
#7. Print the sub operation “{Num2} - {Num1} = {Diff}”
print(Num2, "-",Num1, "=", Diff)
#8. Print the multiply operation “{Sum} * {Diff} = {Product}”
print(Sum, "*", Diff, "=", Product)
#9. Print the sum, sub and multiply operations together. See “program run” below.
#( 47 + 102 ) * ( 102 - 47 ) = 8195
print("(",Num1,"+",Num2,") * (",Num2,"-",Num1,") =",Product)
